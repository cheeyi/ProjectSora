# ProjectSora (Destinations)
### Team members
This iOS app was written over the span of 2 days (excluding setting up CocoaPods and the project directory) for the Expedia Worldwide Engineering (EWE) December 2015 Hackathon, by Chee Yi Ong (@cheeyi) and Barry Brown (@barrybro) from the Minneapolis iOS team.

### Features
The app does the following:
* Detects device's current location and shows the airport that is closest to it
* Queries Expedia's API to obtain an average flight price from that airport to a few other popular destinations (MSP, SEA, LAX, JFK for now)
* Displays the above information in a radar chart for easy visualization, and in a table view at the bottom
* Displays local activities pulled from Expedia's LX API around that destination city when user taps on the location on the radar chart or a table view cell
* A Book button at the top right brings the user directly to the flight/hotel search in the Expedia Bookings app
